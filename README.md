# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). It is a mobile-first, fully responsive QR code card built with React and TypeScript, styled with Flexbox and custom CSS, and closely follows the provided style guide and design specs.
